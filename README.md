## Introduction

Containerisation allows you to compile code that can be easily ported from one platform to another (with some restrictions). As the name suggests, all the dependencies are contained -- there are no undefined references.

The container below comes with an operating system, compilers, and libraries, including MPI. It can be thought as a replacement of the 
module system used on many high performance computers to load in dependencies.
